## How does it work?
<p class="center">Only requirement: a Kubernetes cluster (and we'll even help you with that!). You only need to install the United Manufacturing Hub <a href="">Helm Chart</a> on that cluster and configure it.</p>
<p class="center">The United Manufacturing Hub will then generate all the required files for Kubernetes, including auto-generated secrets, various microservices like bridges between MQTT / Kafka, datamodels and configurations. From there on, Kubernetes will take care of all the container management.</p>

                        <strong>Yes</strong> - the United Manufacturing Hub is targeting specifically people and companies, who do not have the budget and/or knowledge to work on their own / develop everything from scratch.<br><br>
                        With our extensive documentation, guides and knowledge sections you can learn everything that you need.<br><br>
                        The United Manufacturing Hub abstracts these tools and technologies so that you can leverage all advantages, but still focus on what really matters: digitizing your production.<br><br>
                        With our commercial <strong>Management Console</strong> you can manage your entire IT / OT infrastructure and work with Grafana / Node-RED without the need to ever touch or understand Kubernetes, Docker, Firewalls, Networking or similar. <br><br>
                        Additionally, you can get <strong>support licenses</strong> providing unlimited support during development and maintenance of the system. Take a look at our <a href="https://www.umh.app">website</a> if you want to get more information on this.

                        We just want to buy something off-the-shelf (end-to-end solution or IoT platform). Why should we still consider the United Manufacturing Hub?

                        Because very often these solutions do not target the actual pains of an engineer: implementation and maintenance. And then companies struggle in rolling out IIoT as the projects take much longer and cost way more than originally proposed. <br><br>
                        In the United Manufacturing Hub, <strong>implementation and maintenance of the system are the first priority</strong>. We've had these pains too often ourselves and therefore incorporated and developed tools & technologies to avoid them.  <br><br>
                        For example, with <a href="/docs/architecture/microservices/core/sensorconnect/">sensorconnect</a> we can retrofit production machines where it is impossible at the moment to extract data. Or, with our modular architecture we can fit the security needs of all IT departments - 
                        from integration into a demilitarized zone to on-premise and private cloud. With Apache Kafka <a href="https://www.umh.app/post/tools-techniques-for-scalable-data-processing-in-industrial-iot">we solve the pain of corrupted or missing messages when scaling out the system</a>
