<!-- overview -->

All the services deployed in the cluster are visible to each other. That makes it
easy to connect them together.

## Connect to a service from another service

To connect to a service from another service, you can use the service name as the
host name.

To get a list of available services and related ports you can open
{{< resource type="lens" name="name" >}} and go to **Network** > **Services**.

All of them are available from within the cluster. The ones of type LoadBalancer
are also available from outside the cluster using the node IP.

## Example

The most common use case is to connect to the MQTT Broker from Node-RED.

To do that, when you create the MQTT node, you can use the service name
{{< resource type="service" name="mqttbroker" >}} as the host name and one the ports
listed in the **Ports** column.

{{% notice note %}}
The MQTT service name has changed since version 0.9.10. If you are using an older
version, use `{{< resource type="service" name="mqttbroker-verne" >}}` instead of
`{{< resource type="service" name="mqttbroker" >}}`.
