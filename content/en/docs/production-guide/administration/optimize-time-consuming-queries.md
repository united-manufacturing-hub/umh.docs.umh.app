<!-- overview -->

When you have a large database, it is possible that some queries take a long time
to execute. This especially shows when you are using Grafana and the dropdown
menu in the datasource takes a long time to load or does not load at all.

<!-- steps -->

## Open a shell in the database container

{{< include "open-database-shell.md" >}}

## Create an index

Indexes are used to speed up queries. Run this query to create an index on the
`processvaluetable` table:

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX ON processvaluetable(valuename, asset_id) WITH (timescaledb.transaction_per_chunk);
   ```

## Rollback factoryinsight

If you have already created an index, you can rollback the factoryinsight deployment
to version 0.9.4. This way it will use a less optimized but faster query, significantly
reducing the execution time.

1. From the Deployments section in {{< resource type="lens" name="name" >}}, click
   on **{{< resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" >}}** to open the
   details page.
2. {{< include "deployment-edit.md" >}}
3. Scroll down to the `spec.containers` section and change the `image` value to
   {{< resource type="docker" name="org" >}}/factoryinsight:0.9.4.
4. Click **Save**.
