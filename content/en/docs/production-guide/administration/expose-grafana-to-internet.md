## Enable the ingress

To expose Grafana to the Internet, you need to enable the ingress.

1. Open {{< resource type="lens" name="name" >}} and go to the **Helm** > **Releases**
page.
2. Click the **Upgrade** button and search for Grafana.
3. Scroll down to the `ingress` section
4. Set the `enabled` field to `true`.
5. Add you domain name to the `hosts` field.
6. Click **Upgrade** to apply the changes.

Remember to add a DNS record for your domain name that points to the external IP
address of the Kubernetes host. You can find the external IP address of the
Kubernetes host on the **Nodes** page in {{< resource type="lens" name="name" >}}.
