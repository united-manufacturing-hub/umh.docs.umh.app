This installation method can now be done automatically by using the [Community Edition of the Management Console](https://mgmt.docs.umh.app/). Go check it out!

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to deploy the UMH stack using [k3d](https://k3d.io), a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

## Requirements

- Operating system (64-bit):
    - Windows 10 version 2004 and higher or Windows 11
- Hardware:
    - CPU: 2 cores or more
    - RAM: 8GB or more
    - Storage: 10GB free

## Dependencies

1. Verify that you have WSL installed.
    - Open Powershell and type `wsl --status`. If you get an error you probably need to install it.
      Refer to the Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on how to do that.

2. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows)
3. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual)

## Installation

1. Make sure your Docker Desktop application is running.
2. Open a PowerShell terminal. Be sure to use the option Run as Administrator.
3. Install kubectl
    
    `choco install kubernetes-cli`
    
4. Install helm
    
    `choco install kubernetes-helm`
    
5. Install k3d
`choco install k3d`
6. Create the cluster
    
    `k3d cluster create united-manufacturing-hub`
    
7. Create a namespace in Kubernetes
`kubectl create namespace united-manufacturing-hub`
    1. If you get an error like this (the IP doesn’t matter):
        
        ```
        Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp 123.456.789.132:63074: connectex: 
        A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly 
        respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because 
        connected host has failed to respond.
        ```
        
        delete your k3d cluster and re-create it with the api-port flag:
        
        1. `k3d cluster delete united-manufacturing-hub`
        2. `k3d cluster create united-manufacturing-hub --api-port 127.0.0.1:6443`
8. Add the UMH repo
`helm repo add united-manufacturing-hub https://repo.umh.app/`
9. Ensure it is up-to-date with 
`helm repo update`
10. Install the stack 
    
    `helm install united-manufacturing-hub united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub -n united-manufacturing-hub`
    
11. Open UMHLens on your device. You can get UMHLens for free from this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens).
12. Sometimes UMHLens automatically creates a k3d-Cluster. Click on Browse-Clusters to check. If there is no cluster you have to create it manually (follow step 13-18) otherwise continue with step 18.
13. Get the Helm config to import into UMHLens
    
    `kubectl config view --raw`
    
14. Click the three horizontal lines in the upper left corner and choose files → preferences
15. Click on Kubernetes and select “Add custom repo”, type in `https://repo.umh.app`
 as the URL and decide on a name for the repository.
16. Click again file → Add Cluster
17. Paste the clipboard (which you got from `kubectl config view --raw`) into the kubectl prompt of UMHLens.
18. Click on Add Cluster.
19. Click on Browse Clusters in Catalog, then connect to the Cluster.
20. Click on Helm -> Releases and change the namespace from default to united-manufacturing-hub in the upper right corner
    
    ![lens-namespaces](/images/installation/local-k3d-installation/lens-namespaces.png)
    
21. Click on the Release `united-manufacturing-hub`to be able to inspect the values.yaml file, which holds the configurations of all microservices used in the cluster.

## What’s next

You have successfully deployed the UMH stack using k3d.

The next step will be to gather some kind of data, and since you did a local installation you probably want to simulate it. We have a guide to generate data with an [MQTT Simulator](https://learn.umh.app/guides/umh/working-with-the-data/tutorial/mqtt-sim).

You could also directly connect NodeRED without having data. Follow [this guide](https://learn.umh.app/guides/getstarted/data-manipulation/node-red-basic/) to see how.

If you are not sure on what to do you can get back to the [Getting Started](https://learn.umh.app/getstarted) page.
