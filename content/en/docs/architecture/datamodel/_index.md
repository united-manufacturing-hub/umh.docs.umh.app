## Raw Data

If you have raw sensor data that you want to transport using the stack, simply send it to the `raw` topic.
This data will not be processed by the UMH stack, but you can use it to build your own data processing pipeline.

### ProcessValue Data

If you have data that does not fit in the other topics, you can use the `processValue` topic.
It will be saved in the database and can act as a key-value store.

### Production Data

In a production environment, you should first declare products using [addProduct](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/addproduct).
This allows you to create an order using [addOrder](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/addorder). Once you have created an order, 
send an [activity](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/activity) message to tell the database that the machine is working on the order. You can also add shifts using [addShift](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/addshift).

When the machine is ordered to produce a product, send a [startOrder](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/startorder) message.
When the machine has finished producing the product, send an [endOrder](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/endorder) message.

If the state of the machine changes (for example, if it is stopped), send a [state](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/state) message. 
Send [count](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/count) messages if the machine has produced a product.

### Modifying Data

If you have accidentally sent the wrong state or if you want to modify a value, you can use the [modifyState](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/modifystate) message.

### Unique Product Tracking

You can use [uniqueProduct](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/uniqueproduct) to tell the database that a new instance of a product has been created.
If the produced product is scrapped, you can use [messages/addproduct/](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/addproduct/) to change its state to scrapped.
