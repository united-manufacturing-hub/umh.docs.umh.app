# States Documentation Index

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the various states used in the United Manufacturing Hub software stack to calculate OEE/KPI and other production metrics.

## State Categories
- **[Active (10000-29999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/active/)**: These states represent that the asset is actively producing.
- **[Material (60000-99999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/material)**: These states represent that the asset has issues regarding materials.
- **[Operator (140000-159999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/operator)**: These states represent that the asset is stopped because of operator related issues.
- **[Planning (160000-179999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/planning)**: These states represent that the asset is stopped as it is planned to stop (planned idle time).
- **[Process (100000-139999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/process)**: These states represent that the asset is in a stop, which belongs to the process and cannot be avoided.
- **[Technical (180000-229999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/technical)**: These states represent that the asset has a technical issue.
- **[Unknown (30000-59999)](/docs/architecture/datamodel/states/unknown)**: These states represent that the asset is in an unspecified state.
