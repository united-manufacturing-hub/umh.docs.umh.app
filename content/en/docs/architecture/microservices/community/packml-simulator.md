PackML MQTT Simulator is a virtual line that interfaces using PackML implemented
over MQTT. It implements the following PackML State model and communicates
over MQTT topics as defined by environmental variables. The simulator can run
with either a basic MQTT topic structure or SparkPlugB.

## {{% heading "configuration" %}}

You shouldn't need to configure PackML Simulator manually, as it's configured
automatically when the cluster is deployed. However, if you need to change the
configuration, you can do it by editing the `packmlmqttsimulator` section of the
Helm chart values file.
