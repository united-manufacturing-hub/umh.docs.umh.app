The OPCUA Simulator is a microservice that simulates OPCUA devices. You can read
the full documentation on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/amine-amaach/simulators/tree/main/ioTSensorsOPCUA).

You can then connect to the simulated OPCUA server via Node-RED and read the
values of the simulated devices. Learn more about how to connect to the OPCUA
simulator to Node-RED in [our guide](https://learn.umh.app/course/creating-a-node-red-flow-with-simulated-opc-ua-data/).
