The United Manufacturing Hub has several simulators. These simulators simulate different data types/protocols such as MQTT, PackML or OPC/UA. In this chapter we will take the MQTT simulated data and show you how to format it into the [UMH data model](/docs/architecture/datamodel/).


## Creating Node-RED flow with simulated MQTT-Data

1. Access Node-RED with UMHLens.
2. From the left-hand column, drag a **mqtt-in** node, a **mqtt-out** node, and a **debug** node into your flow.
3. Connect the **mqtt-in** and to the **debug-node**.

4. Double-click on the **mqtt-in** node and add a new MQTT broker. To do so, click on **Edit** and use the service name of HiveMQ as the host (located in UMHLens under **services** -> name). Leave the port as autoconfigured and click on **Add** to save your changes.

5. To view all incoming messages from a specific topic, type `ia/#` under **Topic** and click on **Done**.

6. To apply the changes, click on **Deploy** located at the top right of the screen. Once the changes have been deployed, you can view the debug information by clicking on **Debug-Messages** located under **Deploy**.

7. In this column, you can view all incoming messages and their respective topics. The incoming topics follow this format: `ia/raw/development/ioTSensors/`. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using only the temperature topic, but feel free to choose any topic you'd like. To proceed, copy the temperature topic (`ia/raw/development/ioTSensors/Temperature`), open the **mqtt-in** node, paste the copied topic in the **Topic** field, click on **Done**, and then press **Deploy** again to apply the changes.

8. To format the incoming message, add a **JSONÜÜ node and a **Function** node to your flow. Connect the nodes in the following order: **mqtt-in → JSON → Function → mqtt-out**.

   ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewNodes.png)
9. Open the **function** node and paste in the following:

   ```jsx
   msg.payload ={
    
       "timestamp_ms": Date.now(), 
       "temperature": parseFloat(msg.payload, 10)
   }
   msg.topic = "ia/factoryinsight/Aachen/testing/processValue";
   return msg;
   ```
   
{{% notice note %}}
We are creating a new object (array) with two keys `timestamp_ms` and `temperature` and their corresponding value `Date.now()` and `parseFloat(msg.payload,10)`.
The `parseFloat` function converts the incoming string into a float with the base 10 and the `Date.now()` creates a timestamp.
We also created a `msg.topic` for the **mqtt-out node**, which will automatically apply this topic. 
The topic ends with the key **processValue** which is used whenever a custom process value with unique name has been prepared. The value is numerical. You can learn more about our message structure [here](/docs/architecture/datamodel/messages/).
{{% /notice %}}

10. Add another **mqtt-in** node to your flow, and set the topic to `ia/factoryinsight/Aachen/testing/processValue`. Make sure to select the created broker. Connect a **debug** node to the new **mqtt-in** node, and then click on **Deploy** to save the changes.

    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewDebug.png)
11. You should now see the converted message under **Debug-messages**. To clear any previous messages, click on the trash bin icon.

12. Congratulations, you have successfully converted the incoming message and exported it via MQTT. However, since we are currently only exporting the temperature without actually working with the data, let's create a function that counts the critical temperature exceedances.
13. Drag another **function-node** into your flow, open it and navigate to **On Start**.

    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManOnStart.png)
14. Paste in the following code, which will only run on start:

    ```jsx
    flow.set("count", 0);
    flow.set("current", 0)
    ```

15. Then click on **On-Message** and paste in the following and click **done**:

    ```jsx
    flow.set("current",msg.payload);
    if (flow.get("current")>47){
        flow.set("count", flow.get("count")+1);
        msg.payload = {"TemperatureWarning":flow.get("count"),"timestamp_ms":Date.now()}
        msg.topic = "ia/factoryinsight/Aachen/testing/processValue";
        return msg;
    }
    ```

    The pasted in code will work as shown in the diagram below.

16. Finally, connect the function-node like shown below and click on **deploy**.

    ![Untitled](/images/getstarted/dataAcquisitionManipulation/getStartedDataAcqManNewFunction.png)
17. If the incoming value of temperature is now greater than 47, you will see another message consisting of TemperatureWarning and a timestamp in debug-messages.
