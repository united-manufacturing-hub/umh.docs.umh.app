## Local installation using the Management Console (recommended, Windows only)

We've put together a comprehensive guide on how to install the UMH locally on your computer using our **Management Console**. The Management Console is a desktop application allowing you to setup, configure and maintain your IT / OT infrastructure - independent whether it is deployed as a test instance on the same device as the Management Console, or on an edge-device, on-premise server or in the cloud.

To access the documentation, simply click on the button below.

Please note that the Management Console is only available under Windows and only allows setting up test instances on the same device. If you are using Linux or Mac, please look into the [production guides for OS specific installation tutorials](/docs/production-guide/installation/).
