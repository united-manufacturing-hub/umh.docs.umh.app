## Local installation using the Management Console (recommended, Windows only)

We've put together a comprehensive guide on how to install the UMH locally on your computer using our **Management Console**. The Management Console is a desktop application allowing you to setup, configure and maintain your IT / OT infrastructure - independent whether it is deployed as a test instance on the same device as the Management Console, or on an edge-device, on-premise server or in the cloud.

To access the documentation, simply click on the button below.

Please note that the Management Console is available at the moment **under Windows only** and only allows setting up test instances on the same device. **If you are using Linux or Mac**, please look into the [production guides for OS specific installation tutorials](/docs/production-guide/installation/).
