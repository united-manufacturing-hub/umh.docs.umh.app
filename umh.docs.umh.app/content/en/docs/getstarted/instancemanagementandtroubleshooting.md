This chapter covers the management and troubleshooting of your United Manufacturing Hub (UMH) instance.
The usual way to interact with your UMH instance is through the Management Console.
However, for heavy troubleshooting or automations, you might want to interact with your instance through the command line.
This chapter will guide you through the process of accessing your instance, as well as provide you with some common commands and how to resolve issues.

## Manage the Instance

Before you begin, ensure that you are connected to the same network as the
instance for accessing the various services and features discussed below.

### Access the Command Line

Access your device's shell either directly or via SSH. Note: Root user access is required for the following commands.

### Interact with the Instance

First, set this environment variable:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

{{% notice note %}}
You can bypass this by adding the flag `--kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to all your `kubectl` commands. Root privileges are needed to access it.
The installation path of kubectl might vary (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` on RHEL/Linux,
`/opt/bin/kubectl` on flatcar).
{{% /notice %}}

Then, to get a list of pods, run:

<!-- This command is tested within #1153 -->

```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub  --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

For a comprehensive list of commands, refer to the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands).

{{% notice note %}}
Always specify the namespace when running a command by adding `-n united-manufacturing-hub` or set the default namespace with `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=united-manufacturing-hub`.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Access Node-RED

Node-RED is used in UMH for creating data flows. Access it via:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:1880/nodered
```

#### Access Grafana

UMH uses Grafana for dashboard displays. Get your credentials:

<!-- These two commands are tested within #1153 -->

```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) get secret grafana-secret --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -o jsonpath="{.data.adminuser}" | base64 --decode; echo
sudo $(which kubectl) get secret grafana-secret --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub -o jsonpath="{.data.adminpassword}" | base64 --decode; echo
```

Then, access Grafana here:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:8080
```

Use the retrieved credentials to log in.

#### Access the RedPanda Console

Manage the Kafka broker via the RedPanda Console:

```text
http://<instance-ip-address>:8090
```

#### Interact with the Database

UMH uses TimescaleDB. Open a psql session:

{{< include "open-database-shell.md" >}}

Run SQL queries as needed. For an overview of the database schema, refer to the
[Data Model](/docs/datamodel/database) documentation.

#### Connect MQTT to MQTT Explorer

Use MQTT Explorer for a structured overview of MQTT topics. Connect using the instance's IP and port 1883.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `You must be logged in to the server while using the 'kubectl' Command`

If you encounter the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
E1121 13:05:52.772843  218533 memcache.go:265] couldn't get current server API group list: the server has asked for the client to provide credentials
error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials)
```

This issue can be resolved by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. Run
the following command:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

Alternatively, use the `--kubeconfig` flag to specify the configuration file path:

```bash
sudo $(which kubectl) --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub
```

### "Permission Denied" Error with 'kubectl' Command

Encountering the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
error: error loading config file "/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml": open /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml: permission denied
```

Indicates the need for root access. Run the command with `sudo`, or log in as
the root user.

### kubectl: command not found

If you encounter the error below while using the `kubectl` command:

```text
kubectl: command not found
```

The solution is to use the full path to the `kubectl` binary. You can do this by
prefixing the command with `/usr/local/bin/` (for RHEL and other Linux systems), or `/opt/bin/` (for flatcar) or by adding it to your `PATH`
environment variable:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/kubectl get pods -n united-manufacturing-hub

# or

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

### Viewing Pod Logs for Troubleshooting

Logs are essential for diagnosing and understanding the behavior of your applications and infrastructure. Here's how to view logs for key components:

- **Management Companion Logs**: To view the real-time logs of the Management Companion, use the following command. This can be helpful for monitoring the Companion's activities or troubleshooting issues.

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) logs -f mgmtcompanion-0 -n mgmtcompanion --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

- **TimescaleDB Logs**: For real-time logging of the TimescaleDB, execute this command. It's useful for tracking database operations and identifying potential issues.

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) logs -f united-manufacturing-hub-timescaledb-0 -n united-manufacturing-hub --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

### Restarting a Pod for Troubleshooting

Sometimes, the most straightforward troubleshooting method is to restart a problematic pod. Hereâ€™s how to restart specific pods:

- **Restart Management Companion**: If you encounter issues with the Management Companion, restart it with this command:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) delete pod mgmtcompanion-0 -n mgmtcompanion --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

- **Restart TimescaleDB**: Should TimescaleDB exhibit unexpected behavior, use the following command to restart it:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) delete pod united-manufacturing-hub-timescaledb-0 -n united-manufacturing-hub --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
  ```

### Troubleshooting Redpanda / Kafka

For insights into your Kafka streams managed by Redpanda, these commands are invaluable:

- **List All Topics**: To get an overview of all topics in your Redpanda cluster:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub  united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic list
  ```

- **Describe a Specific Topic**: For detailed information about a specific topic, such as `umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging`, use:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic describe umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging
  ```

- **Consume Messages from a Topic**: To view messages from a topic like `umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging`, this command is useful for real-time data observation:

  ```bash
  sudo $(which kubectl) exec -it --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml -n united-manufacturing-hub united-manufacturing-hub-kafka-0 -- rpk topic consume umh.v1.e2e-enterprise.aachen.packaging
  ```

## What's next?

Now that you have learned how to monitor, manage and configure your UMH instance
with the Management Console, you can start creating your first data flow. To
learn how to do this, proceed to the [Data Acquisition and Manipulation](/docs/getstarted/dataacquisitionmanipulation)
