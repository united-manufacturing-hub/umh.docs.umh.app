This page describes how to upgrade the United Manufacturing Hub to version
0.9.14. Before upgrading, remember to backup the
[database](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/backup-timescale/),
[Node-RED flows](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/import-export-node-red/),
and your cluster configuration.

## Add Helm repo in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}

Check if the UMH Helm repository is added in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}.
To do so, from the top-left menu, select **FIle** > **Preferences** (or press `CTRL + ,`).
Click on the **Kubernetes** tab and check if the **Helm Chart** section contains
the `https://repo.umh.app` repository.

If it doesn't, click the **Add Custom Helm Repo** button and fill in the following
values:

- Helm repo name: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo" %}}
- URL: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo-url" %}}

Then click **Add**.

## Clear Workloads

Some workloads need to be deleted before upgrading. This process _does not_ delete
any data, but it will cause downtime. If a workload is missing, it means that it
was not enabled in your cluster, therefore you can skip it.

To delete a resource, you can select it using the box on the left of the
resource name and click the **-** button on the bottom right corner.

1. Open the **Workloads** tab.
2. From the **Deployment** section, delete the following deployments:
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="opcuasimulator" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttsimulator" %}}
3. From the **StatefulSet** section, delete the following statefulsets:
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="kafkabroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="nodered" %}}
4. Open the **Network** tab.
5. From the **Services** section, delete the following services:
   - {{% resource type="service" name="kafkabroker" %}}

## Upgrade Helm Chart

Now everything is ready to upgrade the Helm chart.

1. Navigate to the **Helm** > **Releases** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="helm" name="release" %}} release and click
   **Upgrade**.
3. In the **Helm Upgrade** window, make sure that the `Upgrade version` field
   contains the version you want to upgrade to.
4. You can also change the values of the Helm chart, if needed. For example,
   if you want to apply the new tweaks to the resources in order to avoid the
   Out Of Memory crash of the MQTT Broker, you can change the following values:

   ```yaml
   iotsensorsmqtt:
     resources:
       requests:
         cpu: 10m
         memory: 20Mi
       limits:
         cpu: 30m
         memory: 50Mi
   opcuasimulator:
     resources:
       requests:
         cpu: 10m
         memory: 20Mi
       limits:
         cpu: 30m
         memory: 50Mi
   packmlmqttsimulator:
     resources:
       requests:
         cpu: 10m
         memory: 20Mi
       limits:
         cpu: 30m
         memory: 50Mi
   tulipconnector:
     resources:
       limits:
         cpu: 30m
         memory: 50Mi
       requests:
         cpu: 10m
         memory: 20Mi
   redis:
     master:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: 100m
           memory: 100Mi
         requests:
           cpu: 50m
           memory: 50Mi
   mqtt_broker:
     resources:
       limits:
         cpu: 500m
         memory: 1700Mi
       requests:
         cpu: 100m
         memory: 100Mi
   ```

5. Click **Upgrade**.

The upgrade process can take a few minutes. The upgrade is complete when the
**Status** field of the release is Deployed.
