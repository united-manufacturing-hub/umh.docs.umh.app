This page describes how to upgrade the United Manufacturing Hub to version
0.9.4. Before upgrading, remember to backup the
[database](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/backup-timescale/),
[Node-RED flows](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/import-export-node-red/),
and your cluster configuration.

## Add Helm repo in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}

Check if the UMH Helm repository is added in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}.
To do so, from the top-left menu, select **FIle** > **Preferences** (or press `CTRL + ,`).
Click on the **Kubernetes** tab and check if the **Helm Chart** section contains
the `https://repo.umh.app` repository.

If it doesn't, click the **Add Custom Helm Repo** button and fill in the following
values:

- Helm repo name: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo" %}}
- URL: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo-url" %}}

Then click **Add**.

<!-- Add here any steps needed before deleting the deployments and statefulsets -->

## Clear Workloads

Some workloads need to be deleted before upgrading. This process _does not_ delete
any data, but it will cause downtime. If a workload is missing, it means that it
was not enabled in your cluster, therefore you can skip it.

To delete a resource, you can select it using the box on the left of the
resource name and click the **-** button on the bottom right corner.

1. Open the **Workloads** tab.
2. From the **Deployment** section, delete the following deployments:
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="barcodereader" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttkafkabridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttsimulator" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="opcuasimulator" %}}
3. From the **StatefulSet** section, delete the following statefulsets:
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="nodered" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="sensorconnect" %}}

<!-- Add here any steps needed before upgrading the Helm Chart -->

## Upgrade Helm Chart

Now everything is ready to upgrade the Helm chart.

1. Navigate to the **Helm** > **Releases** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="helm" name="release" %}} release and click
   **Upgrade**.
3. In the **Helm Upgrade** window, make sure that the `Upgrade version` field
   contains the version you want to upgrade to.
4. You can also change the values of the Helm chart, if needed.

   - If you have enabled the [Kafka Bridge](/docs/architecture/microservices/core/kafka-bridge/),
     find the section
     `_000_commonConfig.kafkaBridge.topicmap` and set the value to the following:

     ```yaml
     - bidirectional: false
       name: HighIntegrity
       send_direction: to_remote
       topic: ^ia\.(([^r.](\d|-|\w)*)|(r[b-z](\d|-|\w)*)|(ra[^w]))\.(\d|-|\w|_)+\.(\d|-|\w|_)+\.((addMaintenanceActivity)|(addOrder)|(addParentToChild)|(addProduct)|(addShift)|(count)|(deleteShiftByAssetIdAndBeginTimestamp)|(deleteShiftById)|(endOrder)|(modifyProducedPieces)|(modifyState)|(productTag)|(productTagString)|(recommendation)|(scrapCount)|(startOrder)|(state)|(uniqueProduct)|(scrapUniqueProduct))$
     - bidirectional: false
       name: HighThroughput
       send_direction: to_remote
       topic: ^ia\.(([^r.](\d|-|\w)*)|(r[b-z](\d|-|\w)*)|(ra[^w]))\.(\d|-|\w|_)+\.(\d|-|\w|_)+\.(process[V|v]alue).*$
     ```

     For more information, see the
     [Kafka Bridge configuration](/docs/architecture/microservices/core/kafka-bridge/#configuration)

   - If you have enabled [Barcodereader](/docs/architecture/microservices/community/barcodereader/),
     find the `barcodereader` section and set the
     following values, adding the missing ones and updating the already existing
     ones:

     ```yaml
     enabled: false
     image:
       pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
     resources:
       requests:
         cpu: "2m"
         memory: "30Mi"
       limits:
         cpu: "10m"
         memory: "60Mi"
     scanOnly: false # Debug mode, will not send data to kafka
     ```

5. Click **Upgrade**.

The upgrade process can take a few minutes. The process is complete when the
**Status** field of the release is Deployed.
