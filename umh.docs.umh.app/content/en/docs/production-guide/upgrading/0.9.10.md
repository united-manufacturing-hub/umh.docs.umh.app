This page describes how to upgrade the United Manufacturing Hub to version
0.9.10. Before upgrading, remember to backup the
[database](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/backup-timescale/),
[Node-RED flows](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/import-export-node-red/),
and your cluster configuration.

## Add Helm repo in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}

Check if the UMH Helm repository is added in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}.
To do so, from the top-left menu, select **FIle** > **Preferences** (or press `CTRL + ,`).
Click on the **Kubernetes** tab and check if the **Helm Chart** section contains
the `https://repo.umh.app` repository.

If it doesn't, click the **Add Custom Helm Repo** button and fill in the following
values:

- Helm repo name: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo" %}}
- URL: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo-url" %}}

Then click **Add**.

## Grafana plugins

In this release, the Grafana version has been updated from 8.5.9 to 9.3.1.
Check the [release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/) for
further information about the changes.

Additionally, the way default plugins are installed has changed. Unfortunatly,
it is necesary to manually install all the plugins that were previously installed.

If you didn't install any plugin other than the default ones, you can skip this
section.

Follow these steps to see the list of plugins installed in your cluster:

1. Open the browser and go to the Grafana dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** > **Plugins** tab.
3. Select the **Installed** filter.

4. Write down all the plugins that you manually installed. You can recognize
   them by **not** having the `Core` tag.

   ![Image of core and signed plugins](/images/production-guide/upgrading/0.9.10/core_signed.png)

   The following ones are installed by default, therefore you can skip them:
    - ACE.SVG by Andrew Rodgers
    - Button Panel by UMH Systems Gmbh
    - Button Panel by CloudSpout LLC
    - Discrete by Natel Energy
    - Dynamic Text by Marcus Olsson
    - FlowCharting by agent
    - Pareto Chart by isaozler
    - Pie Chart (old) by Grafana Labs
    - Timepicker Buttons Panel by williamvenner
    - UMH Datasource by UMH Systems Gmbh
    - Untimely by factry
    - Worldmap Panel by Grafana Labs

## Clear Workloads

Some workloads need to be deleted before upgrading. This process _does not_ delete
any data, but it will cause downtime. If a workload is missing, it means that it
was not enabled in your cluster, therefore you can skip it.

To delete a resource, you can select it using the box on the left of the
resource name and click the **-** button on the bottom right corner.

1. Open the **Workloads** tab.
2. From the **Deployment** section, delete the following deployments:
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="barcodereader" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="grafana" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttkafkabridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttsimulator" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="opcuasimulator" %}}
3. From the **StatefulSet** section, delete the following statefulsets:
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="nodered" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="sensorconnect" %}}

## Upgrade Helm Chart

Now everything is ready to upgrade the Helm chart.

1. Navigate to the **Helm** > **Releases** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="helm" name="release" %}} release and click
   **Upgrade**.
3. In the **Helm Upgrade** window, make sure that the `Upgrade version` field
   contains the version you want to upgrade to.
4. You can also change the values of the Helm chart, if needed.
   <!-- Add here any changes needed to the values.yaml -->
   - In the `grafana` section, find the `extraInitContainers` field and change
     its value to the following:

     ```yaml
         - image: unitedmanufacturinghub/grafana-umh:1.1.2
           name: init-plugins
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           command: ['sh', '-c', 'cp -r /plugins /var/lib/grafana/']
           volumeMounts:
             - name: storage
               mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
     ```

   - Make these changes in the `kafka` section:
     - Set the value of the `heapOpts` field to `-Xmx2048m -Xms2048m`.
     - Replace the content of the `resources` section with the following:

       ```yaml
           limits:
             cpu: 1000m
             memory: 4Gi
           requests:
             cpu: 100m
             memory: 2560Mi
       ```

5. Click **Upgrade**.

The upgrade process can take a few minutes. The upgrade is complete when the
**Status** field of the release is Deployed.

Afterwards, you can reinstall the additional Grafana plugins.

## Replace VerneMQ with HiveMQ

In this upgrade we switched from using VerneMQ to HiveMQ as our MQTT Broker
(you can read the
[blog article](https://www.umh.app/post/comparing-mqtt-brokers-for-the-industrial-iot)
about it).

While this process is fully backwards compatible, we suggest to update NodeRed
flows and any other additional service that uses MQTT, to use the new service
broker called {{< resource type="service" name="mqttbroker" >}}. The old
{{< resource type="service" name="mqttbroker-verne" >}} is still functional and,
despite the name, also points to HiveMQ, but in future upgrades will be removed.

Additionally, for production environments, we recommend to
[enable RBAC for the MQTT Broker](/docs/production-guide/security/hivemq-rbac).

{{% notice warning %}}
Please double-check if all of your services can connect to the new MQTT broker.
It might be needed for them to be restarted, so that they can resolve the DNS
name and get the new IP. Also, it can happen with tools like chirpstack, that you
need to specify the client-id as the automatically generated ID worked with
VerneMQ, but is now declined by HiveMQ.
{{% /notice %}}

## {{% heading "troubleshooting" %}}

### Some microservices can't connect to the new MQTT broker

If you are using the {{% resource type="service" name="mqttbroker" %}} service,
but some microservice can't connect to it, restarting the microservice might
solve the issue. To do so, you can delete the Pod of the microservice and let
Kubernetes recreate it.

### ChirpStack can't connect to the new MQTT broker

ChirpStack uses a generated client-id to connect to the MQTT broker. This
client-id is not accepted by HiveMQ. To solve this issue, you can set the
`client_id` field in the `integration.mqtt` section of the chirpstack configuration
file to a fixed value:

```toml
[integration]
...
  [integration.mqtt]
  client_id="chirpstack"
```
