This page describes how to upgrade the United Manufacturing Hub to version
0.9.7. Before upgrading, remember to backup the
[database](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/backup-timescale/),
[Node-RED flows](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/import-export-node-red/),
and your cluster configuration.

## Add Helm repo in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}

Check if the UMH Helm repository is added in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}.
To do so, from the top-left menu, select **FIle** > **Preferences** (or press `CTRL + ,`).
Click on the **Kubernetes** tab and check if the **Helm Chart** section contains
the `https://repo.umh.app` repository.

If it doesn't, click the **Add Custom Helm Repo** button and fill in the following
values:

- Helm repo name: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo" %}}
- URL: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo-url" %}}

Then click **Add**.

<!-- Add here any steps needed before deleting the deployments and statefulsets -->

## Clear Workloads

Some workloads need to be deleted before upgrading. This process _does not_ delete
any data, but it will cause downtime. If a workload is missing, it means that it
was not enabled in your cluster, therefore you can skip it.

To delete a resource, you can select it using the box on the left of the
resource name and click the **-** button on the bottom right corner.

1. Open the **Workloads** tab.
2. From the **Deployment** section, delete the following deployments:
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="barcodereader" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttkafkabridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttsimulator" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="opcuasimulator" %}}
3. From the **StatefulSet** section, delete the following statefulsets:
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="nodered" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="sensorconnect" %}}

<!-- Add here any steps needed before upgrading the Helm Chart -->

## Upgrade Helm Chart

Now everything is ready to upgrade the Helm chart.

1. Navigate to the **Helm** > **Releases** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="helm" name="release" %}} release and click
   **Upgrade**.
3. In the **Helm Upgrade** window, make sure that the `Upgrade version` field
   contains the version you want to upgrade to.
4. You can also change the values of the Helm chart, if needed.
   <!-- Add here any changes needed to the values.yaml -->
   - Make these changes in the `grafana` section:
     - Replace the content of `datasources` with the following:

       ```yaml
           datasources.yaml:
             apiVersion: 1
             datasources:
             - access: proxy
               editable: false
               isDefault: true
               jsonData:
                 apiKey: $FACTORYINSIGHT_PASSWORD
                 apiKeyConfigured: true
                 customerId: $FACTORYINSIGHT_CUSTOMERID
                 serverURL: http://united-manufacturing-hub-factoryinsight-service/
               name: umh-datasource
               orgId: 1
               type: umh-datasource
               url: http://united-manufacturing-hub-factoryinsight-service/
               version: 1
             - access: proxy
               editable: false
               isDefault: false
               jsonData:
                 apiKey: $FACTORYINSIGHT_PASSWORD
                 apiKeyConfigured: true
                 baseURL: http://united-manufacturing-hub-factoryinsight-service/
                 customerID: $FACTORYINSIGHT_CUSTOMERID
               name: umh-v2-datasource
               orgId: 1
               type: umh-v2-datasource
               url: http://united-manufacturing-hub-factoryinsight-service/
               version: 1
       ```

     - Replace the content of `env` with the following:

       ```yaml
           GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS: umh-datasource,umh-factoryinput-panel,umh-v2-datasource
       ```

     - Replace the content of `extraInitContainers` with the following:

       ```yaml
         - name: init-umh-datasource
           image: unitedmanufacturinghub/grafana-plugin-extractor:0.1.3
           volumeMounts:
           - name: storage
             mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
       ```

   - In the `timescaledb-single` section, make sure that the `image.tag` field
     is set to pg13.8-ts2.8.0-p1.
5. Click **Upgrade**.

The upgrade process can take a few minutes. The upgrade is complete when the
**Status** field of the release is Deployed.

<!-- Add here any steps needed after upgrading the Helm Chart -->

## Change Factoryinsight API version

The Factoryinsight API version has changed from v1 to v2. To make sure that
you are using the new version, click on any Factoryinsight Pod and check that the
`VERSION` environment variable is set to 2.

If it's not, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Workloads** > **Deployments** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}} deployment.
3. {{< include "deployment-edit" >}}
4. Find the `spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` field.
5. Set the `value` field of the `VERSION` variable to 2.
