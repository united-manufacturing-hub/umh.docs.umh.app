This page describes how to upgrade the United Manufacturing Hub to version
0.9.12. Before upgrading, remember to backup the
[database](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/backup-timescale/),
[Node-RED flows](/docs/production-guide/backup_recovery/import-export-node-red/),
and your cluster configuration.

## Add Helm repo in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}

Check if the UMH Helm repository is added in {{% resource type="lens" name="name" %}}.
To do so, from the top-left menu, select **FIle** > **Preferences** (or press `CTRL + ,`).
Click on the **Kubernetes** tab and check if the **Helm Chart** section contains
the `https://repo.umh.app` repository.

If it doesn't, click the **Add Custom Helm Repo** button and fill in the following
values:

- Helm repo name: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo" %}}
- URL: {{% resource type="helm" name="repo-url" %}}

Then click **Add**.

## Backup RBAC configuration for MQTT Broker

This step is only needed if you enabled RBAC for the MQTT Broker and changed the
default password. If you did not change the default password, you can skip this
step.

1. Navigate to **Config** > **ConfigMaps**.
2. Select the {{% resource type="configmap" name="mqttbroker-credentials" %}}
   ConfigMap.
3. Copy the content of `credentials.xml` and save it in a safe place.

## Clear Workloads

Some workloads need to be deleted before upgrading. This process _does not_ delete
any data, but it will cause downtime. If a workload is missing, it means that it
was not enabled in your cluster, therefore you can skip it.

To delete a resource, you can select it using the box on the left of the
resource name and click the **-** button on the bottom right corner.

1. Open the **Workloads** tab.
2. From the **Deployment** section, delete the following deployments:
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="barcodereader" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="factoryinsight" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttkafkabridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="mqttsimulator" %}}
   - {{% resource type="deployment" name="opcuasimulator" %}}
3. From the **StatefulSet** section, delete the following statefulsets:
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbridge" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="mqttbroker" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="nodered" %}}
   - {{% resource type="statefulset" name="sensorconnect" %}}

<!-- Add here any steps needed before upgrading the Helm Chart -->

## Remove MQTT Broker extension PVC

In this version we reduced the size of the MQTT Broker extension PVC. To do so,
we need to delete the old PVC and create a new one. This process will set the
credentials of the MQTT Broker to the default ones. If you changed the default
password, you can restore them after the upgrade.

1. Navigate to **Storage** > **Persistent Volume Claims**.
2. Select the {{% resource type="pvc" name="mqttbroker-extensions" %}} PVC and
   click **Delete**.

## Upgrade Helm Chart

Now everything is ready to upgrade the Helm chart.

1. Navigate to the **Helm** > **Releases** tab.
2. Select the {{% resource type="helm" name="release" %}} release and click
   **Upgrade**.
3. In the **Helm Upgrade** window, make sure that the `Upgrade version` field
   contains the version you want to upgrade to.
4. There are some incompatible changes in this version. To avoid errors, you
   need to change the following values:

   - Remove property `console.console.config.kafka.tls.passphrase`:

     ```yaml
     console:
       console:
         config:
           kafka:
             tls:
               passphrase: "" # <- remove this line
     ```

   - `console.extraContainers`: remove the property and its content.

     ```yaml
     console:
       extraContainers: {} # <- remove this line
     ```

   - `console.extraVolumeMounts`: remove the `|-` characters right after the
     property name. It should look like this:

     ```yaml
     console:
       extraVolumeMounts: # <- remove the `|-` characters in this line
         - name: united-manufacturing-hub-kowl-certificates
           mountPath: /SSL_certs/kafka
           readOnly: true
     ```

   - `console.extraVolumes`: remove the `|-` characters right after the
     property name. It should look like this:

     ```yaml
     console:
       extraVolumes: # <- remove the `|-` characters in this line
         - name: united-manufacturing-hub-kowl-certificates

     ```

   - Change the Redis URI in `factoryinsight.redis`:

     ```yaml
     factoryinsight:
       redis:
         URI: united-manufacturing-hub-redis-headless:6379
     ```

   - Set the following values in the `kafka` section to `true`, or add them if
     they are missing:

     ```yaml
     kafka:
       externalAccess:
         autoDiscovery:

         enabled: false                # <- remove this line
         thresholds:                   # <- remove this line
           readOnlyFreeMB: 64          # <- remove this line
           readOnlyFreePercent: 5      # <- remove this line
           readWriteFreeMB: 128        # <- remove this line

5. Click **Upgrade**.
