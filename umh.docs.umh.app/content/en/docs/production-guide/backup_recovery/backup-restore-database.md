<!-- overview -->

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

For this task, you need to have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
installed on your machine.

You also need to have enough space on your machine to store the backup. To check
the size of the database, follow the steps below:

{{< include "open-database-shell" >}}

5. Run the following command to get the size of the database:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('factoryinsight'));
    ```

<!-- steps -->

## Backing up the database

Follow these steps to create a backup of the factoryinsight database on your
machine:

1. Open a terminal, and using the `cd` command, navigate to the folder where
   you want to store the backup. For example:

   {{< tabs name="change-dir" >}}
   {{< tab name="Windows" codelang="powershell" >}}
   cd C:\Users\user\backups
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="macOS" codelang="bash">}}
   cd /Users/user/backups
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Linux" codelang="bash" >}}
   cd /home/user/backups
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   If the folder does not exist, you can create it using the `mkdir` command or
   your file manager.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pg_dump -h <REMOTE_HOST> -p 5432 -U factoryinsight -Fc -f <BACKUP_NAME>.bak factoryinsight
   ```

   - `<REMOTE_HOST>` is the IP of the server where the database is running.
     Use `localhost` if you installed the United Manufacturing Hub using k3d.
   - `<BACKUP_NAME>` is the name of the backup file.

### Grafana database

If you want to backup the Grafana database, you can follow the same steps as
above, but you need to replace any occurence of `factoryinsight` with
`grafana`.

Additionally, you also need to write down the credentials in the
{{< resource type="secret" name="grafana" >}} Secret, as they will be needed
to access the dashboard after restoring the database.

## Restoring the database

{{< notice warning >}}
This section is untested. Please report any issues you encounter.
{{< /notice >}}

For this section, we assume that you are restoring the data to a fresh United
Manufacturing Hub installation with an empty database.

### Copy the backup file to the database pod

1. Open {{< resource type="lens" name="name" >}}.
2. Launch a new terminal sesstion by clicking on the **+** button in the
   bottom-left corner of the window.
3. Run the following command to copy the backup file to the database pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl cp /path/to/local/backup.bak {{< resource type="pod" name="database" >}}:/tmp/backup.bak
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/local/backup.bak` with the path to the backup file on your
   machine.

This step could take a while depending on the size of the backup file.

### Temporarly disable kafkatopostrgesql

1. Navigate to **Workloads** > **Deployments**.
2. Select the {{< resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" >}} Deployment.
3. {{< include "deployment-scale" >}}
4. Scale the number of replicas to 0.

### Open a shell in the database pod

{{< include "open-database-shell" >}}

### Restore the database

1. Drop the existing database:

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE factoryinsight;
   ```

2. Create a new database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE factoryinsight;
   \c factoryinsight
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
   ```

3. Put the database in maintenance mode:

   ```sql
   SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();
   ```

4. Restore the database:

   ```sql
   \! pg_restore -Fc -d factoryinsight /tmp/backup.bak
   ```

5. Take the database out of maintenance mode:

   ```sql
   SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();
   ```

### Enable kafkatopostgresql

1. Navigate to **Workloads** > **Deployments**.
2. Select the {{< resource type="deployment" name="kafkatopostgresql" >}} Deployment.
3. {{< include "deployment-scale" >}}
4. Scale the number of replicas to the original value, usually 1.
