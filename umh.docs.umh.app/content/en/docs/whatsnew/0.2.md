## 0.2.0

### Management Console

- The Data Connections and Data Sources administration has been revised, and now
  it's all in one place called Connection Management. This new concept revolves
  around the idea of a connection, which is just a link between your UMH instance
  and a data source. You can then configure the connection to fetch data from the
  source, and monitor its status. Additionally, you can now edit existing connections
  and data source configurations, and delete them if you don't need them anymore.

## 0.2.1

### Management Console

- Fixed a bug that returned a failed-to-update error when trying to update the
  Companion from version 0.1.0 to 0.2.0, even though the update was successful.
- Now is possible to fetch all the dependencies from a single domain, instead of
  having to fetch them from multiple domains. This is useful when the UMH instance
  is behind a firewall, and the domains are not accessible from the outside.
