## Historian functionalities

The new `v2` API of Factoryinsight now supports historian functionalities. This
means that you can now query the history of your data and visualize it in
Grafana. The new datasource plugin for Grafana supports the Time Bucket
Aggregation, which allows you to aggregate your data by values like the average,
minimum or maximum.
