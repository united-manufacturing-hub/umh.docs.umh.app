## Data Bridge

[Data-bridge](/docs/architecture/microservices/core/data-bridge/) is a microservice
specifically tailored to adhere to the
[UNS](https://learn.umh.app/lesson/navigating-data-flow-understanding-data-models/)
data model. It consumes topics from a message broker, translates them to
the proper format and publishes them to the other message broker.

It can consume from and publish to both Kafka and MQTT brokers, whether they are
local or remote.

It's main purpose is to merge messages from multiple topics into a single topic,
using the message key to identify the source topic.

## Updated dependencies

We updated the following dependencies:

- [RedPanda](https://redpanda.com/) to version 23.2.8
- [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/) to the community edition version 2023.7
