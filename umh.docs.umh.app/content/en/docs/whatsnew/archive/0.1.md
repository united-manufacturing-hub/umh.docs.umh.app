<!-- overview -->

Welcome to United Manufacturing Hub version 0.1! This marks the first release of
the United Manufacturing Hub, even though it's been available for a while now.

You might have already seen other versions (probably the ones in the [archive](/docs/whatsnew/archive/)),
but those were only referring to the UMH Helm chart. This new versioning is meant
to include the entire United Manufacturing Hub, as defined in the [architecture](/docs/architecture/).

So from now on, the United Manufacturing Hub will be versioned as a whole, and
will include the Management Console, the Data Infrastructure, and the Device &
Container Infrastructure, along with all the other bits and pieces that make up
the United Manufacturing Hub.

## 0.1.0

### Data Infrastructure

- The Helm chart version has been updated to 0.9.34. This marks one of the final steps
  towards the full integration of the new [data model](/docs/datamodel/). It is
  now possible to format the data into the ISA95 standard, send it through the
  Unified Namespace, and store it in the Historian.

### Management Console

There are many features already available in the Management Console, so we'll
only list the most important ones here.

- Provision the Data Infrastructure
- Configure and manage connections and data sources
- Visualize the Unified Namespace and the data flow
- Upgrade the Management Companion directly from the Management Console. You will
  first need to
  [manually upgrade](/docs/production-guide/upgrading/upgrading/#i-installed-the-management-companion-before-the-010-release-how-do-i-upgrade-it)
  it to this version, and then for all the future versions you will be able to do
  it [directly from the Management Console](/docs/features/devicecontainerinfrastructure/upgrading/).

### Benthos-UMH

- Connect OPC-UA servers to the United Manufacturing Hub
- Configure how each node will send data to the Unified Namespace
