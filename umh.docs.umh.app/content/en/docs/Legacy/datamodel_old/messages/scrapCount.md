## Usage

Here a message is sent every time products should be marked as scrap. It works as follows: A message with scrap and timestamp_ms is sent. It starts with the count that is directly before timestamp_ms. It is now iterated step by step back in time and step by step the existing counts are set to scrap until a total of scrap products have been scraped.

## Content

- ``timestamp_ms`` is the unix timestamp, you want to go back from
- ``scrap`` number of item to be considered as scrap.


{{% notice note %}}
1. You can specify maximum of 24h to be scrapped to avoid accidents
2. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) If counts does not equal scrap, e.g. the count is 5 but only 2 more need to be scrapped, it will scrap exactly 2. Currently, it would ignore these 2. see also #125
3. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) If no counts are available for this asset, but uniqueProducts are available, they can also be marked as scrap.
