Located in the `united-manufacturing-hub/umh.docs.umh.app/content/<language_code>/docs` folder, the
majority of United Manufacturing Hub documentation is specific to the [United Manufacturing Hub
project](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub).

## What's allowed

United Manufacturing Hub docs allow content for third-party projects only when:

- Content documents software in the United Manufacturing Hub project
- Content documents software that's out of project but necessary for United Manufacturing Hub to function

## {{% heading "whatsnext" %}}

- Read the [Style guide](/docs/development/contribute/documentation/style/style-guide).
