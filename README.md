Within this section, you can find information about [contributing to UMH docs](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/development/contribute/documentation/). Guidelines are provided for [adding documentation](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/development/contribute/new-content/add-documentation/), and it is possible to make small [changes using GitHub](https://umh.docs.umh.app/docs/development/contribute/new-content/add-documentation/#changes-using-github) without needing to understand git!
